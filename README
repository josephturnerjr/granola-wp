Just a super-simple Wordpress plugin that creates a sidebar widget with your Granola Share information in it. My first WP plugin. 

INSTALLATION
Copy the whole granola directory (what little of it there is) into [WORDPRESS ROOT]/wp-content/plugins and enable the plugin in your administrator interface.
